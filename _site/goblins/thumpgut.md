title: Thumpgut
position: Ball Percussion
desc: |
  Thumpgut was born in the depths of the _Underbelly_, where the echoes of ancient drums still resonate.

  He plays a set of goblin-made **ball percussions** that he claims are "tuned to the heartbeat of the earth."

  Every beat is a prayer to "_The Great Rolling One_," and his performances are said to summon tremors.
excerpt: A devout follower of "The Great Rolling One", every strike is a divine message.
