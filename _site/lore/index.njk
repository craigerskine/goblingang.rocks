  - title: Wretchmaw Awakens
    ico: 👁️
    lore: |
      Foreshadowing...

  - title: Bowling for Blood
    ico: 🎳
    lore: |
      [Thumpgut](/goblins/thumpgut/) receives a vision from the _Great Rolling One_: the time of ritual combat has come. Blood must be spilled upon the sacred lanes to awaken forgotten power. The goblins challenge rival tribes in gruesome, bowling-based duels. Pins are teeth. Balls are relics. Heads roll.

  - title: Fungus Brew Blues
    ico: 🍄
    lore: |
      After the bloodshed, the gang drinks deep from hallucinogenic fungal brews. Their minds fracture, and each sees a different version of truth. The brew reveals memories of rot, moldy ancestors, and a voice murmuring from the pit below: _Wretchmaw_ is not alone.

  - title: Bloodroot Lullaby
    ico: 🥱
    lore: |
      The goblins rest beneath the bloom of bloodroot flowers, which grow only in cursed soil. In sleep, they dream of past goblin queens and kings — lullabies once sung now warped by centuries of darkness. The _Hollow King's_ childhood is hinted at here — lonely and buried.

  - title: Teeth in the Tunnels
    ico: 🦷
    lore: |
      Awakened by whispers and stone gnawing, the goblins journey deeper underground. They're not alone. Something old and sharp moves through the dark — bone serpents, blind leeches, and worse. One goblin disappears. Another returns changed.

  - title: Hymn to the Great Rolling One
    ico: 🛼
    lore: |
      They reach the sacred underground altar. [Thumpgut](/goblins/thumpgut/) leads a ritual — a pounding, rhythmic chant to the _Great Rolling One_. Glowing runes, ancient bowling balls with divine carvings, and rhythmic chanting echo through the halls. The _Hollow King_ appears briefly in vision — weeping.

  - title: Echoes of Mold
    ico: 🔊
    lore: |
      The goblins ascend again — but nothing is the same. The tunnels shift. Familiar voices echo, twisted by time and decay. The mold remembers everything. The gang realizes the _Hollow King_ has been watching, feeding on their fear. He is the mold.

  - title: Shriek of the Hollow King
    ico: 😱
    lore: |
      The old tyrant falls, but his scream births something worse: **_Wretchmaw_**.
