  ## 👁️ Wretchmaw Awakens

  Foreshadowing...

  ***

  ## 🎳 Bowling for Blood

  [Thumpgut](/goblins/thumpgut/) receives a vision from the _Great Rolling One_: the time of ritual combat has come. Blood must be spilled upon the sacred lanes to awaken forgotten power. The goblins challenge rival tribes in gruesome, bowling-based duels. Pins are teeth. Balls are relics. Heads roll.

  ***

  ## 🍄 Fungus Brew Blues

  After the bloodshed, the gang drinks deep from hallucinogenic fungal brews. Their minds fracture, and each sees a different version of truth. The brew reveals memories of rot, moldy ancestors, and a voice murmuring from the pit below: _Wretchmaw_ is not alone.

  ***

  ## 🥱 Bloodroot Lullaby

  The goblins rest beneath the bloom of bloodroot flowers, which grow only in cursed soil. In sleep, they dream of past goblin queens and kings — lullabies once sung now warped by centuries of darkness. The _Hollow King's_ childhood is hinted at here — lonely and buried.

  ***

  ## 🦷 Teeth in the Tunnels

  Awakened by whispers and stone gnawing, the goblins journey deeper underground. They're not alone. Something old and sharp moves through the dark — bone serpents, blind leeches, and worse. One goblin disappears. Another returns changed.

  ***

  ## 🛼 Hymn to the Great Rolling One

  They reach the sacred underground altar. [Thumpgut](/goblins/thumpgut/) leads a ritual — a pounding, rhythmic chant to the _Great Rolling One_. Glowing runes, ancient bowling balls with divine carvings, and rhythmic chanting echo through the halls. The _Hollow King_ appears briefly in vision — weeping.

  ***

  ## 🔊 Echoes of Mold

  The goblins ascend again — but nothing is the same. The tunnels shift. Familiar voices echo, twisted by time and decay. The mold remembers everything. The gang realizes the _Hollow King_ has been watching, feeding on their fear. He is the mold.

  ***

  ## 😱 Shriek of the Hollow King

  The old tyrant falls, but his scream births something worse: **_Wretchmaw_**.
