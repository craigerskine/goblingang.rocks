## Bleachfang

Born deep in the caves of Gloomhollow, Bleachfang never saw sunlight, which explains his ghostly skin and glowing red eyes. He learned guitar by strumming spiderwebs and eventually crafted his axe from bat bones and cursed ivory. He rarely speaks, but when he shreds — the dead twitch.

## Klockpunchor

Once a paper-pusher for the Bureau of Tunnel Logistics, Scabbert quit after a rage fit involving ink imps and a flaming ledger. Now, he manages Goblin Gang with a clipboard made from troll hide and drinks 14 cups of fungus brew a day. No one knows when he sleeps.

## Snagglevox

Snagglevox’s voice cracked open a cave ceiling at age 7. His guitar strings snap constantly — some say from his unhinged energy, others claim he bites them mid-solo. He writes lyrics in bloodroot ink and considers chaos a musical note.

## Thumpgut

A devout follower of The Great Rolling One, Blorbo believes every strike is a divine message. Raised in the echoing temple-lanes beneath Goblin Gulch, he trained as both a bowler and a drum mystic. His bowling balls are sacred relics, each etched with cryptic runes and names of long-dead goblin saints. During shows, he chants gutter-bound hymns and sends the balls crashing in time with the rhythm of the underworld.

## Riffrot

Legend says his guitar is strung with goblin sinew. It wails when hungry. No one knows where Riffrot came from—some say he emerged from a collapsed mine, others swear he was carved from a cursed tree by lightning. His guitar, Wretchmaw, is strung with goblin sinew and sealed with bone sap. It doesn’t just scream—it hungers. Between solos, Riffrot feeds it scraps of broken strings and beetle shells. If he doesn’t, it starts to hum... and not in tune.
