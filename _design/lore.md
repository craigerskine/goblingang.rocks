## 🧛🏻‍♂️ Bleachfang

Born deep in the caves of Gloomhollow, Bleachfang never saw sunlight, which explains his ghostly skin and glowing red eyes. He learned guitar by strumming spiderwebs and eventually crafted his axe from bat bones and cursed ivory. He rarely speaks, but when he shreds — the dead twitch.

## ✝️ Thumpgut

A devout follower of The Great Rolling One, Blorbo believes every strike is a divine message. Raised in the echoing temple-lanes beneath Goblin Gulch, he trained as both a bowler and a drum mystic. His bowling balls are sacred relics, each etched with cryptic runes and names of long-dead goblin saints. During shows, he chants gutter-bound hymns and sends the balls crashing in time with the rhythm of the underworld.

## 🎤 Snagglevox

Snagglevox’s voice cracked open a cave ceiling at age 7. His guitar strings snap constantly — some say from his unhinged energy, others claim he bites them mid-solo. He writes lyrics in bloodroot ink and considers chaos a musical note.

## 🎸 Qranog

Legend says his guitar is strung with ork sinew. He learned to carve sound from stone long before he touched a guitar. Obsessed with forgotten frequencies and ancient tech, he built his first instrument from cracked relics and vibrating boneplates.

## 📋 Klokpunchr

Once a paper-pusher for the Bureau of Tunnel Logistics, he quit after a rage fit involving ink imps and a flaming ledger. Now, he manages Goblin Gang with a clipboard made from troll hide and drinks 14 cups of fungus brew a day. No one knows when he sleeps.
