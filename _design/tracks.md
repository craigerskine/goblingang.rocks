## 1. Wretchmaw Awakens

- **Mood:** A slow crawl from darkness, heavy and looming.
- **Key:** We'll center it around G minor, so we can end on G (3rd fret low E string).
- **Tempo:** ~60 BPM, one note at a time.

```
e|-----------------------------|
B|-----------------------------|
G|------------------2~---------|
D|-------------0-----------3~--|
A|-------2---------------------|
E|-3~--------------------------| ← start G
```

- Let each note ring out.
- The final G (3rd fret low E) will also be the first note of the final track.
- Add a touch of vibrato or let it decay naturally for mood.

## 2. Bowling for Blood

## 3. Fungus Brew Blues

## 4. Bloodroot Lullaby

## 5. Teeth in the Tunnels

## 6. Hymn to the Great Rolling One

## 7. Echoes of Mold

## 8. Shriek of the Hollow King

- **Mood:** Distant, echoing collapse — like a throne room caving in.
- **Key:** Also G minor, but more broken, mournful.
- **Goal:** Ends on the same G (3rd fret low string) as the start of Wretchmaw.

```
e|-----------------------------|
B|---------------1-------------|
G|------0-------------0~-------|
D|-3---------3-----------------|
A|-----------------------------|
E|--------------------------3~-| ← final G
```

- Again, super slow — this feels like the last breath of a doomed king.
- Optionally fade out with reverb or slide down after the final note.

⚠️⚠️ First and last tracks start and end on G for seamless playback. The Hollow King's death becomes the Wretchmaw's rebirth.
