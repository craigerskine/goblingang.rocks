## 1: Wretchmaw Awakens

- **Mood:** A slow crawl from darkness, heavy and looming.
- **Key:** We'll center it around G minor, so we can end on G (3rd fret low E string).
- **Tempo:** ~60 BPM, one note at a time.

```
e|-----------------------------|
B|-----------------------------|
G|-----3~----------------------|
D|---5-----3~----1-------------|
A|-5---------------------------|
E|-------------------3~--------| ← ends on G (3rd fret low E)
```

- Let each note ring out.
- The final G (3rd fret low E) will also be the first note of the final track.
- Add a touch of vibrato or let it decay naturally for mood.

## 8: Shriek of the Hollow King

- **Mood:** Distant, echoing collapse — like a throne room caving in.
- **Key:** Also G minor, but more broken, mournful.
- **Goal:** Ends on the same G (3rd fret low string) as the start of Wretchmaw.

```
e|-----------------------------|
B|---3~----1-------------------|
G|---------3~-----0------------|
D|---5~----------3~------------|
A|-----------------------------|
E|----------3~-----------------| ← final G
```

- Again, super slow — this feels like the last breath of a doomed king.
- Optionally fade out with reverb or slide down after the final note.

Both tracks start and end on G for seamless playback. The Hollow King's death becomes the Wretchmaw's rebirth.
